
## üå∏ Introduction to Closures in JavaScript

### üß† **What is a Closure?**

In **JavaScript**, a **closure** is created when a **function "remembers" variables from its outer (enclosing) function's scope** ‚Äî even after the outer function has finished running.
It‚Äôs like a secret memory of the function.

**In simple terms:**

> A closure lets a function **access variables outside of its own scope**.

---
## Example 1
## üí° Example Breakdown ‚Äî Your Code:

Here‚Äôs the code:

```javascript
function outer(){
    let a = 10;

    function inner(){
        a++;
    }

    console.log(`Calling Outer Funtion "a" => ${a}`);
    inner();
    console.log(`Calling inner Funtion "a" => ${a}`);
}

console.log(outer);
outer();
```

---

## üß© Step-by-Step Explanation:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **outer() function definition**

```javascript
function outer(){
    let a = 10;
    ...
}
```

* When you **define** the function `outer`, JavaScript **doesn't run it yet**.
* `a = 10` is a local variable inside `outer()`.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **inner() function inside outer()**

```javascript
function inner(){
    a++;
}
```

* `inner()` is a function **inside** `outer()`.
* **Important:** `inner()` can access `a` because it‚Äôs inside `outer()`.
  This is the **closure** in action!
* `a` is not in `inner()`‚Äôs own scope, but because of closure, it can still access `a` from `outer()`.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Printing outer() itself**

```javascript
console.log(outer);
```

* This logs the **function definition** of `outer()` (the whole function code) to the console.
* It‚Äôs like printing the blueprint of `outer()`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Calling outer()**

```javascript
outer();
```

Here‚Äôs what happens **step by step** when `outer()` runs:

‚úÖ `let a = 10;` ‚Üí variable `a` is created inside `outer`.

‚úÖ The line:

```javascript
console.log(`Calling Outer Funtion "a" => ${a}`);
```

prints:

```
Calling Outer Funtion "a" => 10
```

‚úÖ Then you call `inner();`:

```javascript
inner();
```

This runs the **inner()** function:

* It accesses `a` from `outer()` (closure in action) and does:

```javascript
a++; // a = 11
```

‚úÖ Finally:

```javascript
console.log(`Calling inner Funtion "a" => ${a}`);
```

prints:

```
Calling inner Funtion "a" => 11
```

‚úÖ So the final output of `outer()` is:

```
Calling Outer Funtion "a" => 10
Calling inner Funtion "a" => 11
```

---

## üß† Why is this a **Closure**?

‚úÖ The `inner()` function **closes over** (captures) the variable `a` from its outer function `outer()`.
‚úÖ It **remembers** `a` and can modify it, even though `a` is not inside `inner()` directly.

---

## üìå Final Output Recap:

```
∆í outer(){
    let a = 10;
    function inner(){
        a++;
    }
    console.log(`Calling Outer Funtion "a" => ${a}`)
    inner();
    console.log(`Calling inner Funtion "a" => ${a}`)
}
Calling Outer Funtion "a" => 10
Calling inner Funtion "a" => 11
```

---

## üéØ Summary:

‚úÖ A **closure** lets a function like `inner()` access variables like `a` from an outer function `outer()`.
‚úÖ Closures are **created automatically** in JavaScript when functions are nested.
‚úÖ This is super useful for keeping data private or creating factory functions.

---
## Example 2:


## üí° **Your Code Breakdown:**

```javascript
function outerCounter(){
    let count = 0
    console.log(`value of outerCounter count = ${count}`)

    function innerCounter(){
        count ++;
        console.log(`Count increased to ${count}`);
    }

    function getCount(){
        return count;
    }

    return {innerCounter, getCount}
}
```

---

### üß© Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **outerCounter() function definition**

* You define a function `outerCounter`. It has:

  * A **local variable**: `let count = 0`
  * Two **inner functions**:

    * `innerCounter()` (increments `count`)
    * `getCount()` (returns current `count`)

* Inside `outerCounter()`, the line:

```javascript
console.log(`value of outerCounter count = ${count}`)
```

will print:

```
value of outerCounter count = 0
```

whenever `outerCounter()` is called.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **What does outerCounter() return?**

This line:

```javascript
return {innerCounter, getCount}
```

returns an **object** with two properties:

```javascript
{
  innerCounter: innerCounter,
  getCount: getCount
}
```

In other words, it returns an object containing references to the two inner functions.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **First console.log(outerCounter)**

This:

```javascript
console.log(outerCounter)
```

logs the **function definition** of `outerCounter` itself. It does **not** run the function.
Output will look like:

```
∆í outerCounter() { ... }
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Calling outerCounter()**

This:

```javascript
const object = outerCounter();
```

does **two things**:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Calls `outerCounter()`, so the code inside it runs:

* `let count = 0` is created.
* The console logs:

```
value of outerCounter count = 0
```

* Then it **returns the object**:

```javascript
{
  innerCounter: innerCounter,
  getCount: getCount
}
```

and assigns it to the variable `object`.

So now:

```javascript
object.innerCounter
object.getCount
```

are functions you can call later!

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Calling object.innerCounter() multiple times**

Let‚Äôs break down:

```javascript
object.innerCounter();
object.innerCounter();
object.innerCounter();
```

#### First call:

* Runs `innerCounter()`:

  * Accesses `count` from `outerCounter` (closure in action).
  * Increments `count`:

    ```
    count = 0 + 1 = 1
    ```
  * Logs:

    ```
    Count increased to 1
    ```

#### Second call:

* Increments `count` again:

  ```
  count = 1 + 1 = 2
  ```

  * Logs:

    ```
    Count increased to 2
    ```

#### Third call:

* Increments `count` again:

  ```
  count = 2 + 1 = 3
  ```

  * Logs:

    ```
    Count increased to 3
    ```

‚úÖ **Key point**:
Even though `outerCounter()` has *finished running*, the `count` variable is **still in memory**, because the returned functions (`innerCounter` and `getCount`) are still **holding a reference to it** ‚Äî this is the power of **closures**.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Get the current count**

```javascript
console.log(`Current Count Value => object.getCount():  `,object.getCount())
```

* Calls `getCount()`:
* Returns `count`, which is now 3.
* Logs:

```
Current Count Value => object.getCount():   3
```

---

## üß† **What is happening internally? (Closure Magic)**

‚úÖ The variable `count` belongs to `outerCounter`‚Äôs local scope.
‚úÖ The functions `innerCounter()` and `getCount()` **"remember"** this scope.
‚úÖ As long as you have a reference to these functions, the scope of `outerCounter()` (with the `count` variable) **does not get destroyed**.
‚úÖ The `count` variable stays alive and can be modified or accessed.

This is exactly what **closures** are all about.

---

## üìä Final Output Recap

```
∆í outerCounter(){...}
value of outerCounter count = 0
Count increased to 1
Count increased to 2
Count increased to 3
Current Count Value => object.getCount():   3
```

---

## üéØ Summary

‚úÖ `outerCounter()` creates a **closure**.
‚úÖ The variable `count` is "captured" by the returned functions and **persists in memory**.
‚úÖ Each time you call `object.innerCounter()`, it modifies that same `count` variable.
‚úÖ This is how you can create **private variables** and **encapsulated state** in JavaScript using closures!

---

## Example 3:

## üåü **Introduction: Closures & the Module Pattern in JavaScript**

A **closure** happens when an inner function remembers variables from its outer function‚Äôs scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows us to create **private variables** and methods that aren‚Äôt directly accessible from the outside.

In this example, you are using a popular pattern in JavaScript called the **Module Pattern**.
This pattern:
‚úÖ Creates a private scope for data (like `score` here)
‚úÖ Returns an object that exposes specific functions (like `increaseScore`, `decreaseScore`, `getScore`)
‚úÖ Helps you **encapsulate** logic and protect data from being directly changed.

---

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Code Breakdown**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Function Definition: `ScoreCalculation()`

```javascript
function ScoreCalculation(){
    let score = 0;
```

* `score` is a **local variable** initialized to `0`.
* It **cannot** be accessed from outside directly ‚Äî it‚Äôs **private**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Inner Functions

You define three **nested functions**:

#### a) `increaseScore(points)`

```javascript
function increaseScore(points){
    score += points;
    console.log(`+${points} pts`);
}
```

* It **adds** the given `points` to `score` and logs the update.

---

#### b) `decreaseScore(points)`

```javascript
function decreaseScore(points){
    score -= points;
    console.log(`-${points} pts`);
}
```

* It **subtracts** the given `points` from `score` and logs the change.

---

#### c) `getScore()`

```javascript
function getScore(){
    console.log(`Total Score: ${score}`);
}
```

* It prints the **current total** score.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Returning an Object (The Module Pattern)

```javascript
return {increaseScore, decreaseScore, getScore};
```

* This **returns an object** with references to the three inner functions.
* These functions can **access** and **modify** the `score` variable because they are closures over the `ScoreCalculation()` scope.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating an Instance: `scoreBoard`

```javascript
const scoreBoard = ScoreCalculation();
```

* This calls `ScoreCalculation()` and:

  * Initializes a **new, private** `score` (starts at `0`).
  * Returns the object with `increaseScore`, `decreaseScore`, and `getScore`.
* The returned object is stored in `scoreBoard`.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `console.log(ScoreCalculation)`

```javascript
console.log(ScoreCalculation);
```

* This logs the **function definition** of `ScoreCalculation`, like:

```
∆í ScoreCalculation() { ... }
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Updating the Score

```javascript
scoreBoard.increaseScore(15);  // +15 pts
scoreBoard.increaseScore(30);  // +30 pts
scoreBoard.decreaseScore(5);   // -5 pts
scoreBoard.decreaseScore(3);   // -3 pts
```

* These calls:

  * Add or subtract points from the **private** `score` variable.
  * Log the updates:

```
+15 pts
+30 pts
-5 pts
-3 pts
```

‚úÖ All these updates are happening to the **same** `score` variable inside the closure.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Final Score

```javascript
scoreBoard.getScore();  // Total Score: 37
```

Let‚Äôs do the math:

```
0 + 15 + 30 - 5 - 3 = 37
```

It prints:

```
Total Score: 37
```

---

## üéì **What‚Äôs the Closure Here?**

‚úÖ The variable `score` is **private** to the `ScoreCalculation()` function.
‚úÖ The returned functions (`increaseScore`, `decreaseScore`, `getScore`) are **closures** ‚Äî they remember the `score` variable even after `ScoreCalculation()` has finished executing.
‚úÖ This way, you can **safely modify** or **read** the `score` without exposing it directly.
